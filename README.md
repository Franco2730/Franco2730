## <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nixin72/nixin72/master/wave.gif" width="50px" height="50px"></img> About Me

I'm a Back-end-focused Full-stack programmer with a passion for database structures. Ever since I was a child, I've been drawn to fixing computers. Every time I received a gift, the first thing I did was take it apart (I spent many afternoons grounded for that). Knowing how something worked or what was behind it was more important to me.

¿What I Do?
Currently, I'm dedicated to working on projects that allow me to advance in my programming skills.

¿Where I'm Headed?
My main goal is to make a positive impact within a job framework where, through my knowledge and a great team, we can provide solutions to everyday problems or enhance something that's already functional.

¿Who Am I?
I'm a very much a perfectionist; I like to push myself and ensure that my work is a worthy representation of what I can do. I greatly enjoy having a strong team where we all move in the same direction. I'm an avid fan of cinema, sports, and music.
